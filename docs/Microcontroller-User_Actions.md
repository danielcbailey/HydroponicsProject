# User Actions

From the main page the user can press to the rotary encoder knob to open the navigation menu. Navigation menu has some manual actions that users can perform. These will help them monitor the plants and the system as needed.

## Sensor Readings

Sensor readings page display all of the readings from the sensors. There isn't any action that a user can perform from this page. The readings are updated real time. They can be used for plant monitoring purposes. For example, if the pH value has changed this might indicate that the concentration of the nutrient solution went down in the pipes. 

##Light and Pump Control

LED light and water pump are connected to 120 AC via relays. So it is safety critical that user is able to turn on and off the outputs manually anytime. User can turn on and off the lights and the water pump independently. To prevent a fire hazard, when the user selects to turn on the lights, the system will check the air temperature. If the temperature is higher than the maximum temperature value of the system, the lights will not turn on. Similarly, when the user wants to turn on the pumps, the system checks the water level sensor readings. If the value is lower than a minimum water level limit, the pumps will not turn on. This prevents the water pump from being water deprived and getting damaged.
